# Nigeria News Feed using Xamarin
Back in the day, while I was still coding away :computer:, I created a news feed that pulled its feed from some popular Nigerian newspapers :newspaper:. I wasn't focused on the UI 🤷‍♂️, I was learning how to write more code with Xamarin :rocket: and get familiar with the platform. I was just slinging code :code:, learning as I went along. I didn't care about making the UI look pretty, I just wanted to see if I could get the news feed working. And it did! :tada:
